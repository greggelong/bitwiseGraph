## bitwise graph

browsing through Wolfram Mathworld under mathematical art and images of logical functions plotted

here it is in javascript the range I am using for x and y is 0 to 60 not -30 to 30 like 

I am plotting with HSB colors

the direction differs from the wolfram plot as the canvas plots y values up to down and I didn't reverse them
